# Dimensional modelling and ETL data processing

This project was developed as part of the Data Engineering course at the University of Santiago de Compostela. The objective of the lab practice was to design and implement a dimensional model to support the analysis and prediction of flight delays. In the implementation, the data is organized using a star-schema structure, and an ETL pipeline is used to extract, transform, and load the source data into the data warehouse.
